# Use Rust, Axum, PostgreSQL and Shuttle to Build a Blog

This repo is a variation of [this](https://spacedimp.com/blog/using-rust-axum-postgresql-and-tokio-to-build-a-blog/) post on [Space Dimp](https://spacedimp.com/).  I've modified the code such that it can be hosted by [Shuttle](https://shuttle.rs)

## To-Do

Need to creat a variation of the markd binary that the article uses, to get actual blog posts into the database.
